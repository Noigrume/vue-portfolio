#Vue 3 Portfolio Project

Welcome to my Vue 3 Portfolio Project repository!

#About This Project

This project is a part of my journey to learn and master Vue.js, a powerful front-end JavaScript framework. As I continue to explore and experiment with Vue 3, I've decided to build my own portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and journey in web development.

#What to Expect

As this project is a part of my learning journey, you can expect to see a lot of adjustments, improvements, and new features added over time. Here are some of the key features I plan to implement:

    Portfolio Showcase: A dedicated section to display my completed projects and skills.
    Interactive UI: I'll be using Vue 3's reactivity and component-based architecture to create a smooth experience.
    Responsive Design: The portfolio will be designed to look great on all devices, SASS with be implemented .

If you want to run this project locally or explore the code, you can follow the instructions in the README or visit the live demo here.
Thank You
